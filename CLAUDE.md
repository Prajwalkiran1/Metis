# CLAUDE.md — Metis Project Intelligence File

> Single source of truth for Claude Code sessions. Paste this file at the start of every session.
> Update the MODULE STATUS TABLE and ACTIVE MODULE STATE after every session.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. **Starting a session**: Tell Claude which module you're working on and paste this file. Claude reads module status, picks up where you left off, and brainstorms before writing code.
2. **Session contract**: Every session ends with runnable code — routes registered, UI screens navigable, no broken imports — even if features are stubs.
3. **Ending a session**: Ask Claude to "update the module state block" and paste the output back into this file.
4. **Brainstorm mode**: Say "let's brainstorm [module]" and Claude asks clarifying questions before writing code.
5. **Frontend-as-we-go**: Every session ships complete UI for its backend. No "backend now, UI later."
6. **No Claude attribution in commits**: Commits are authored as the developer. No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` lines. No "Generated with Claude Code" footers. Enforced by git config and reinforced per-session.

## WHAT METIS IS

- Role-based web platform: **Admin / HOD / Teacher / Student / Parent**
- **Academic Workflow Engine**: Department-driven, HOD-owned, admin-as-safety-net
- **Smart Attendance**: QR + GPS + face verification (face is M8-pluggable, stubbed until then)
- **Assessment + Grade Engine**: Flexible CIE/SEE schemes, NPTEL handling, eligibility, hall tickets, grade cards
- **Communication**: Announcements, DMs, notifications, per-post parent visibility
- **Content Management**: Material uploads (M7 RAG hooks ready, consumer deferred)
- **AI Layer (deferred)**: Learning Engine (M7) + Insights/Face (M8) — events already publishing, consumers plug in when built

## WHAT METIS IS NOT

- Generic ERP or SAP clone
- Basic CRUD portal
- Prototype — everything written to be deployable and defensible

---

## THE FIVE ROLES (AUTHORITY DISTRIBUTION)

The system is **HOD/teacher-centric**. Admin is the institutional safety net, not the routine operator.

### Admin
- Institutional invariants only: rooms (cross-department), academic calendar (term boundaries), holiday calendar, user bulk onboarding, assessment scheme **catalog** (templates), institutional eligibility thresholds, SEE date scheduling, feature flags, audit log visibility, AICTE compliance reports, system health
- Approves **only** when curriculum changes (new credit-bearing course mid-semester) or institution-wide policy exceptions
- Cannot edit HOD-drafted semester structure on their behalf
- Lightweight notification feed: cross-department resource conflicts, manually-flagged escalations, HOD publish events (informational)

### HOD (Head of Department)
- One per department; can additionally teach (uses `/teacher/*` for own offerings)
- Drafts and **self-publishes** semester structure (admin sees but doesn't approve)
- Designs elective groups, dissolves low-strength electives, migrates students
- Composes lab batches (flexible count — 2, 3, 5, whatever fits)
- Assigns teachers to courses (including cross-department, no admin approval — routine practice)
- Configures CIE schedules (dates, timings, order, venues) within institutional CIE windows
- Approves AAT weight >20% (BMSCE rule)
- Condones attendance up to 10% (BMSCE rule)
- Generates and approves hall tickets for own department (batch operation)
- Uploads SEE marks via CSV; uploads re-evaluation revised marks
- Authorises makeup CIE (rare) and makeup exam workflows
- Assigns tasks (invigilation, paper setting, evaluation duties) to department teachers
- Bulk-onboards parents via CSV for own department
- Sees department analytics, defaulter lists, eligibility status

### Teacher
- Owns day-to-day: attendance, marks, assignments, materials per offering
- Configures per-offering assessment scheme within HOD/admin templates
- Can edit attendance freely until internal deadline; HOD edits after deadline
- Can freeze own course early (per-course freeze, before institutional deadline)
- Can lock/unlock own marks (HOD is backup if teacher unavailable)
- Per-post parent visibility toggle on assignments, announcements, marks publications
- Composes lab batch incharges for integrated courses (HOD overrides if needed)
- Sees roster, student details, private teacher notes (not student-visible)
- NPTEL coordinator role: same teacher role, with an NPTEL offering assigned — coordinator's UI surfaces in `/teacher/courses/{offering_id}` when offering type is NPTEL

### Student
- Identified by **USN** (BMSCE pattern: `1BM` + 2-digit year + 2-letter dept + 3-digit roll, e.g., `1BM23CS001`)
- Registers for courses (mandatory auto-enrolled, electives selected, NPTEL slot selected with specific NPTEL course name)
- Views attendance, marks (with dynamic scheme rendering), assignments, materials, eligibility
- Downloads hall ticket (PDF, re-downloadable)
- Downloads grade card (PDF, multi-version, re-downloadable indefinitely)
- Sees backlog courses (failed/ineligible) auto-added to next semester
- Submits assignments (portal mode) or sees grade for offline-mode assignments
- Requests re-evaluation within HOD-set window

### Parent
- Strictly read-only on linked child(ren)
- Onboarded via admin/HOD CSV upload (Google Form → CSV → bulk parent account creation)
- Linked to student by **USN** in the CSV
- Sees attendance, marks, eligibility, assignments (only when teacher toggled "visible to parents" per post)
- Multiple children supported (up to 2 parent accounts per student — typically mother + father; or 1 guardian)
- Cannot see other students' data; API enforces parent-child link per request

---

## BMSCE REGULATIONS ANCHOR

Institutional rules baked into the eligibility engine and assessment workflows. All thresholds are configurable via `/admin/eligibility-config` but default to BMSCE policy.

### Attendance
- **85%** minimum in each course to qualify for main SEE (theory, lab, integrated separately)
- **60%** minimum per-CIE attendance to qualify for that CIE
- **HOD/Principal/Dean** can condone up to **10%** with documented reason
- **Make-up SEE**: requires 85% attendance also (no separate lower threshold)

### Internal Marks
- **40%** minimum in CIE to qualify for main SEE
- **60%** minimum in CIE to qualify for make-up SEE
- For integrated courses: threshold required **separately in theory AND practical** AND overall

### CIE Structure (default, configurable per scheme template)
- **3 internal tests**, **best 2 of 3** counted
- Default pattern: Test 1 + Test 2 = 80% of CIE; **AAT** = 20% (extendable to 40% with HOD approval)
- Total CIE = 50 marks (reduced from 100-mark internal pattern); SEE = 50 marks (reduced from 100)
- Missed CIE recorded as absent → automatically dropped via best-2-of-3 (no approval needed)
- Makeup CIE for rare cases (missed 2 of 3 with genuine reason) — HOD authorises

### SEE
- Conducted out of 100, rescaled proportionally to 50
- Admin schedules SEE dates (cross-department coordination)
- SEE marks often released semester(s) later — uses transitional grade `I` (incomplete) until released, displayed as "Pending" in UI
- HOD uploads via CSV when results land
- Re-evaluation: standard rule — **can only improve or hold, never reduce** marks

### Grade Card
- Generated at end of each semester per student
- Pending courses (SEE not released) show grade `I` with "Pending" label in UI
- Multi-version: re-evaluation, makeup completion, or late SEE release regenerates with new version
- Re-downloadable indefinitely; old versions retained

### NPTEL Courses (MOOC type)
- Course type: `nptel`
- One faculty assigned as **NPTEL Coordinator** per NPTEL slot per semester
- Students pick which specific NPTEL course (free-text course name field) within the slot
- Coordinator defines mark split (e.g., 40% assignments / 60% final exam) — applies uniformly to all students under the slot regardless of which specific NPTEL course they took
- No attendance tracking
- Student uploads NPTEL certificate as evidence; coordinator verifies + enters marks
- Pending if not completed in semester; can carry to next semester (retake until passed)
- Always visible on student dashboard until passed; appears on grade card of the semester they cleared it

### Hall Ticket
- Generated by system at end of internal deadline, batch-approved by HOD
- Shows per-subject eligibility status; ineligible subjects show **NA**
- One-time-generated PDF (re-downloadable but identical); student prints physical copy for exam hall
- Ineligible due to attendance OR <40% internals → must re-register course next semester

### Backlog Path (failed or ineligible)
- Auto-added to next semester's registration with `backlog` badge
- Must write makeup exam (separate assessment flow)
- Makeup result appears on grade card of the semester they cleared it
- Schema-ready for BMSCE Fast Track Semester (8-week backlog semester) — deferred from MVP

## FRONTEND PHILOSOPHY — FULL PLATFORM, MINIMAL POLISH

```
PHASE: Bare-bones functional UI. Every feature works. Zero design polish.
LATER: Visual redesign AFTER all features verified.

UI RULES (non-negotiable):
  ✅ Every feature in screen inventory MUST be present and functional
  ✅ shadcn/ui base components only (or hand-rolled shadcn-style primitives in apps/web/components/ui.tsx)
  ✅ Simple top nav + sidebar + content area
  ✅ No custom palettes, gradients, animations
  ✅ Tables for tabular, forms for input, cards for grouped info
  ✅ Every button does something (calls real or stub endpoint)
  ✅ Every form validates (react-hook-form + zod) and submits
  ✅ Loading: simple spinner or "Loading…"; errors: plain red text
  ✅ Mobile responsive enough not to break

UI NON-GOALS:
  ❌ Color schemes / brand identity
  ❌ Custom components when shadcn-style exists
  ❌ Hover effects, transitions, micro-interactions
  ❌ Design mockup matching
  ❌ Refactoring working UI for aesthetics

FRONTEND-AS-WE-GO RULE:
  Every backend endpoint shipped in a session has its UI wired and functional in the same session.
  No "backend now, frontend later" — that creates broken module states.

## EVENT BUS — INTER-MODULE COMMUNICATION (BUILT IN M10)

Redis pub/sub. M10 ships the bus. All M1–M4 `TODO(events)` markers get wired during M10d.

```
Sync:   REST internal calls
Async:  Redis pub/sub (no module imports another's models)

```

## DATA LAYER RULES

```
Multi-tenancy:    Every table has college_id. Queries always WHERE college_id = ?
Soft deletes:     deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL. Filter WHERE deleted_at IS NULL.
Audit trail:      Sensitive writes → audit_logs (actor_id, action, old_val, new_val, ts)
Typed overrides:  academic_overrides table (typed semantic actions: condonations, migrations, unlocks)
Timestamps:       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(), updated_at auto-trigger
USN:              Students identified by USN (BMSCE pattern: 1BM + YY + DD + RRR). Validated at create.
Face data:        NEVER stored. Only verification_confidence FLOAT in attendance_records.
Naming:           snake_case. FKs: {table_singular}_id.
SEE versioning:   see_results table — original + optional re_eval + optional makeup, each timestamped.
Grade cards:      grade_card_versions table — old PDFs retained, latest pointer.
```

## BUILD SEQUENCE

**Phase A — Academic Refoundation**
1. **M2 rework** — schema additions (migrations 0007/0008/0009), USN backfill, HOD role, light UI updates (USN-aware admin pages, empty HOD shell)
2. **M10a — Semester Setup + Approval** — HOD draft/publish flow, admin notification feed
3. **M10b — Elective Registration + Dissolution + Cascade**
4. **M10c — Lab Batches + Assessment Scheme Templates + per-offering picker**
5. **M10d — CIE Scheduling + Tasks + Internal Deadlines + Event Bus (Redis pub/sub built here)**
6. **M10e — Hall Tickets + Grade Cards + SEE/Re-eval/Makeup workflows**
7. **M3 rework** — eligibility engine, freeze integration
8. **M4 rework** — scheme integration, NPTEL coordinator UI, grade cards, re-eval/makeup paths

**Phase B — Assignments + Communications**
9. **M11 — Assignments** — full lifecycle, portal+offline, AAT linkage, parent visibility per post
10. **M5 — Communications** — announcements, DMs, notification queue, parent notification fan-out

**Phase C — Content + Admin**
11. **M6 — Content** — uploads, library, versioning; **publishes `material.uploaded` events** (no consumer yet)
12. **M9 — Admin Portal + Analytics** — bulk onboarding, audit viewer, AICTE reports, system health, feature flags

**Phase D — Polish + Deploy**
13. E2E tests, DPDP audit, performance, production deploy

**Phase E — AI Layer (when ready)**
14. **M7 — Learning Engine** — consumes M6 events; tutor UI already exists, point at backend
15. **M8 — Insights + Face Verify** — consumes M3/M4 events; swaps M3 face stub; insights UI already exists

---

## AI DEFERRAL — INTEGRATION POINTS

See `AI_DEFERRAL_PLAN.md` for the full inventory. Summary:

- **M3 face-verify**: `app/modules/attendance/face_stub.py` returns 0.95 confidence. M8 swaps the implementation; signature stable.
- **M6 material upload**: publishes `material.uploaded`. M7 subscribes and ingests when built.
- **M3/M4 events**: `attendance.marked`, `marks.entered`, `assignment.submitted`, `student.migrated` all publish. M8 subscribes for risk scoring.
- **Teacher insights UI**: `/teacher/insights` ships with empty state — "Insights Engine not yet enabled."
- **Student tutor UI**: `/student/tutor` ships as placeholder route — "Tutor coming soon."
- **AI service scaffolds**: `services/learning-engine/` and `services/insights-engine/` are minimal FastAPI apps with `/health` endpoints. Deployment topology correct from day one.

**Core academic logic NEVER depends on M7/M8.** Everything in M1–M6, M9–M11 is fully functional without the AI layer.

## SESSION PROTOCOL

### Starting a session

```
Tell Claude:
  "I am working on [MODULE NAME]. Here is CLAUDE.md. [paste file]"

Claude will:
  1. Read MODULE STATUS TABLE — identify state
  2. Read ACTIVE MODULE STATE block
  3. Open with: "Before I write any code, let me confirm the plan..."
  4. Brainstorm/refine (questions, edge cases)
  5. Write session plan: skeleton vs full
  6. Build — schema first, event contracts first, then service, then UI
  7. End with runnable code + updated state block to paste back
```

### Session contract (Claude must honour)

```
✅ Schema migrations written and applied before service code
✅ Event publish/subscribe wired before business logic (post-M10)
✅ Frontend-as-we-go: every endpoint shipped has UI wired this session
✅ Skeleton rule: module router/pages registered, returning 200/placeholder, no broken imports
✅ Brainstorm before code: at least 3 clarifying questions answered
✅ One module per session: no bleeding into adjacent modules
✅ Update state block at end
✅ shadcn/ui or apps/web/components/ui.tsx primitives only
✅ react-hook-form + zod for all forms
✅ Real or stub endpoint calls, never hardcoded fake JSX arrays
✅ Loading: "Loading…" or spinner; errors: plain red text

❌ No Co-Authored-By: Claude lines in commits
❌ No "Generated with Claude Code" footers
❌ No custom palettes, animations, transitions
❌ No design mockup matching
❌ No deferring frontend work to a later session
```

### Commit message format

```
feat(workflow): add HOD semester setup draft/publish flow
fix(marks): correct best-2-of-3 when student missed CIE-3
chore(schema): add USN column to users with backfill
docs(adr): ADR-010 — assessment scheme catalog vs per-offering rules
```

No Claude attribution. Verify before pushing:
```bash
git log -1 --format='%an %ae'    # should show YOUR name, NOT Claude
git log -1 --format='%B'         # should NOT contain "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or "Generated with Claude Code"

active_module: M10a_shipped

# IMPORTANT for the next session: M2 rework migrations 0007/0008/0009 are
# applied on the local dev DB (head is now 0010 after M10a). The full
# pytest suite passes (86 tests). Next session is M10b (elective
# registration + dissolution + cascade). Boot order remains:
# `docker compose -f infra/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` then
# `cd services/api && uv run alembic upgrade head` to be safe.
#
# Pre-existing seed bug to flag (not M10a-caused): infra/scripts/seed.py
# can insert duplicate academic_calendar rows for 2026-08-15 when
# previous runs left them un-deduped. Dedupe before re-running:
#   docker exec metis_postgres psql -U metis -d metis -c "
#     DELETE FROM academic_calendar WHERE id IN (
#       SELECT id FROM academic_calendar
#       WHERE entry_date = '2026-08-15' AND deleted_at IS NULL OFFSET 1

## PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE (DPDP Act 2023)

```
Consent:           Explicit required before face biometric collection. Opt-out available
                   (fallback: teacher manual mark).
Purpose limit:     Face data only for attendance verification.
Data minimisation: Frame used for verification → immediately discarded. Embedding not stored.
Right to access:   Students request all personal data via Privacy Centre in app.
Right to erasure:  Student-initiated. Anonymised analytics retained for institutional reporting.
Breach notif:      Report to Data Protection Board within 72 hours.
Data fiduciary:    The college (BMSCE) is fiduciary. Metis is data processor → DPA agreement needed.

Parent data:       Parents are linked to students via guardian_links. Parent accounts have
                   strict per-request validation of parent-child link. No cross-student access.

Face data technical policy:
  Enrolled photo → FaceNet embedding (when M8 lands) → stored AES-256 encrypted in users table.
  Decryption key: environment variable (NOT in database).
  Attendance submission: live frame → M8 → cosine similarity → result returned → frame + live embedding
  DELETED FROM MEMORY. Persisted: attendance_records.verification_confidence FLOAT only.
```
